    description: >
      This capability represents a public endpoint which is accessible to the general internet (and its public IP address ranges).
      This public endpoint capability also can be used to create a floating (IP) address that the underlying network assigns from a pool allocated from
      the application’s underlying public network.  This floating address is managed by the underlying network such that can be routed an application’s
      private address and remains reliable to internet clients.
