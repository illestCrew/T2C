tosca.capabilities.Endpoint:
    derived_from: tosca.capabilities.Root
    description: >
      This is the default TOSCA type that should be used or extended to define a network endpoint capability.
      This includes the information to express a basic endpoint with a single port or a complex endpoint with multiple ports.
      By default the Endpoint is assumed to represent an address on a private network unless otherwise specified.
    properties:
      protocol:
        type: string
        description: >
          The name of the protocol (i.e., the protocol prefix) that the endpoint accepts (any OSI Layer 4-7 protocols)
          Examples: http, https, ftp, tcp, udp, etc.
        default: tcp
      port:
        type: tosca.datatypes.network.PortDef
        description: The optional port of the endpoint.
        required: false
        constraints:
          - in_range: [ 1, 65535 ]
      secure:
        type: boolean
        description: Requests for the endpoint to be secure and use credentials supplied on the ConnectsTo relationship.
        required: false
        default: false
      url_path:
        type: string
        description: The optional URL path of the endpoint’s address if applicable for the protocol.
        required: false
      port_name:
        type: string
        description: The optional name (or ID) of the network port this endpoint should be bound to.
        required: false
      network_name:
        type: string
        description: >
          The optional name (or ID) of the network this endpoint should be bound to.
          network_name: PRIVATE | PUBLIC |<network_name> | <network_id>
        required: false
        default: PRIVATE
      initiator:
        type: string
        description: The optional indicator of the direction of the connection.
        required: false
        default: source
        constraints:
          - valid_values: [ source, target, peer ]
      ports:
        type: map
        description: The optional map of ports the Endpoint supports (if more than one).
        required: false
        constraints:

    attributes:
      ip_address:
        type: string
        description: This is the IP address as propagated up by the associated node’s host (Compute) container.
