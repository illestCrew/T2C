tosca.nodes.Root:
    description: >
      This is the default (root) TOSCA Node Type that all other TOSCA nodes should extends.
      This allows all TOSCA nodes to have a consistent set of features for modeling and management
      (e.g, consistent definitions for requirements, capabilities, and lifecycle interfaces).
    attributes:
      tosca_id:
        type: string
        description: A unique identifier of the realized instance of a Node Template that derives from any TOSCA normative type.
      tosca_name:
        type: string
        description: >
          This attribute reflects the name of the Node Template as defined in the TOSCA service template.
          This name is not unique to the realized instance model of corresponding deployed application as each template in the model can result in one
          or more instances (e.g., scaled) when orchestrated to a provider environment.

        type: string
